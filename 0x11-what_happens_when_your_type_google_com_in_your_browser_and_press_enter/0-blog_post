What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter
When you type "https://www.google.com" and press Enter, your browser first needs to find the IP address of Google's server with the help of the Domain Name System (DNS), which acts like the internet's phone book. Your browser sends a request to the DNS to translate "www.google.com" into an IP address. If this information isn't cached on your computer, the request goes to a DNS server, which responds with the IP address.
Next, your browser establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP ensures the data is sent accurately and in the correct order, while IP makes sure the data reaches the right destination. As the data packets travel from your computer to Google's server, they pass through firewalls, security systems that monitor and control network traffic, protecting both your computer and the server from potential threats.
Before any actual data exchange happens, your browser and Google's server establish a secure connection using HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). HTTPS ensures that the data sent between your browser and the server is encrypted, making it difficult for anyone to eavesdrop. SSL is the technology that enables this encryption.
Once the secure connection is established, your request reaches Google's servers, which are numerous to handle billions of requests. A load-balancer helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring fast and reliable responses. it forwards your request to one of Google's web servers, which stores the website's files and serves them to users. The web servers may pass your request to an application server if dynamic content generation is needed. For instance, when you search for something, the application server processes your query to provide relevant results.
To generate these results, the application server often fetches data from a database, a collection of information. Google's database stores information about billions of web pages, and the application server queries this database to find the best matches for your search terms. After gathering the necessary data, the application server sends it back to the web server, which packages it into a format your browser can understand, usually HTML.
The data travels back through the internet, passing through firewalls and routers, using TCP/IP to ensure it arrives correctly and securely. Finally, your browser receives the data, processes it, and renders the web page by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the content properly on your screen.
This entire process happens in just a few seconds, thanks to the sophisticated technologies working behind the scenes. Understanding this gives you a deeper appreciation for the internet and equips you with essential knowledge for any technical career.
