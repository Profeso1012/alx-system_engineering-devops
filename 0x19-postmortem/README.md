Issue Summary:

Duration: March 24, 2023, 07:00 AM - 08:30 AM UTC
Impact: Apache web server returning 500 Internal Server Error, affecting 100% of users trying to access the WordPress site
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in PHP file extension in WordPress settings

Timeline:

07:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alert showing spike in 500 errors
07:05 AM: Engineering team notified and began investigation
07:10 AM: Initial assumption of database connection issue, investigated MySQL logs
07:25 AM: Database connection ruled out, focus shifted to Apache configuration
07:40 AM: Apache logs showed no clear errors, escalated to senior engineer
07:50 AM: Senior engineer suggested using strace to debug the issue
08:10 AM: Root cause identified as PHP file extension misconfiguration
08:20 AM: Manual fix applied to correct file extension
08:25 AM: Puppet script created to automate the fix
08:30 AM: Issue resolved, services restored to normal

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause was a typo in the WordPress configuration where the PHP file extension was incorrectly set to ".phpp" instead of ".php". This caused Apache to fail when trying to execute PHP files, resulting in the 500 Internal Server Error.
The issue was fixed by correcting the file extension in the WordPress configuration file. A Puppet script was then created to automate this fix, ensuring that the correct file extension is always set.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To improve our system reliability and prevent similar issues in the future, we propose the following measures:

Implement more comprehensive configuration testing before deployment.
Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on configuration mismatches.
Develop and maintain a checklist for common configuration issues.
Conduct regular audits of critical configuration files.
Improve documentation for troubleshooting common server errors.

Tasks:

Update deployment process to include configuration validation step.
Enhance monitoring system to check for correct file extensions in critical paths.
Create and implement a pre-deployment checklist that includes common misconfigurations.
Schedule monthly configuration audits for all production servers.
Update internal knowledge base with lessons learned from this incident.
Conduct a training session on using strace and other debugging tools effectively.

This incident highlighted the importance of thorough testing and the value of advanced debugging tools like strace. By implementing these measures, we aim to catch similar issues earlier in the development process and resolve them more quickly if they do occur in production.
